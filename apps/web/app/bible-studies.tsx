        The following section contains a series of end-times Bible studies that
        I've put together over the years. I've done my best to make them short
        and sweet, but I will typically include references for further study if
        you're interested.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you have any questions or confusion, please consult the Bible, pray
        to God, talk to someone you trust, and/or ask EschatoloGPT.

            The Jews worshiping at the temple mount in the land of Israel is a
            prerequisite to the sacrifices and offerings being taken away.
            Therefore, the Jewish nation of Israel, recently formed in 1948, is
            a sign and precursor to this event which takes place 3.5 years
            before Jesus returns.
