          Stop #1 | Romans 3:23
        </ArticleHeader>

        <Scripture
          text="For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God"
          cite="Romans 3:23"
        />

        <p>
          The word “gospel” literally means good news! The reason it's good news
          is that there is bad news. Why would anyone ever believe they need to
          hear the gospel or believe the gospel unless they understood their
          need for the gospel? That's where this passage comes in. Romans 3:23
          is a foundational reminder that we are all sinners. No one is
          righteous (Romans 3:10-12), no one is good, and no one keeps the Ten
          Commandments perfectly. God is holy, and every single human being who
          has ever lived does not perfectly live up to God's standard. Whether
          you've sinned once, or are serving a life sentence in prison for
          murder, whoever fails to keep the whole law in one point is
          accountable for all of it according to God's standard (James 2:10).
        </p>

        <p>
          Sin is a reality that needs to be presented if we are going to
          understand the gospel. Everybody is a sinner. Being a sinner separates
          us from having a relationship with a holy God. We need a solution.
        </p>

          Stop #2 | Romans 5:8
        </ArticleHeader>

        <Scripture
          text="But God demonstrates His own love toward us, in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us."
          cite="Romans 5:8"
        />

        <p>
          The second stop on the Romans Road emphasizes the unconditional love
          of God towards the sinner whom He is willing to save. We were
          unlovable, but He loved us. We were hopeless, but He gives hope. We
          couldn't save ourselves, but Christ could. In our spiritually dead and
          sinful condition (Ephesians 2:1), God chose to show mercy, love, and
          kindness to us.
        </p>

        <p>
          This passage brings Christ into the forefront and provides an
          opportunity to integrate Him into the good news. If it wasn't for God
          sending His Son to deal with sin, we couldn't be saved from the
          penalty of sin. That is where the new stop on our journey comes in.

        <ArticleHeader as="h2" id={Header.SalvationStop3}>
          Stop #3 | Romans 6:23
        </ArticleHeader>

        <Scripture
          text="For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord."
          cite="Romans 6:23"
        />

        <p>
          After stops 1 and 2, a person might readily accept that everyone is a
          sinner, that God loves us, and that Jesus died for us. But stop number
          3 takes us deeper into the bad news, before highlighting more of the
          good news.
        </p>

        <p>
          Upon hearing that “the wages of sin is death,” someone might ask, what
          does that mean? This stop provides you with the opportunity to
          highlight God's wrath towards sin, His dealings with the unrighteous,
          and the reality of a literal heaven and a literal hell (Romans
          1:18-32; Matthew 13:42; Revelation 21:8). The earned payment for sin —
          all sin — is death. Much like a human court system has a standard of
          law that if not kept leads to punishment, God has a law and there is
          punishment for not keeping it. More than that, as human beings who
          readily admit that we are sinners, we must also admit that we cannot
          keep God's law faithfully. Therefore, we all are condemned in God's
          court and deserve the wages for our sin: death.
        </p>

        <p>
          But Romans 6:23 also includes good news! In contrast to our inability
          to keep the law of God and our wages earned by sin, God gives the
          gracious gift of eternal life through Jesus Christ. This aspect of the
          gospel provides you with the opportunity to know and share what Jesus
          did on the cross. He died in the sinner's place. He paid the penalty
          for sin so the sinner wouldn't have to. He gave His life so you could
          live. By "eternal life," the Bible means that you don't need to die
          and end up in hell forever. You don't have to experience the judgment
          of God upon sin for all eternity. You can live in heaven with Him for
          all eternity after this life ends. The Bible teaches that everyone
          will die (everyone knows this is true) and that after death in this
          life comes a moment of judgment (Hebrews 9:27). That moment of
          judgment does not need to end badly.
        </p>

        <p>God has given us a gift. His name is Jesus Christ.</p>

        <ArticleHeader as="h2" id={Header.SalvationStop4}>
          Stop #4 | Romans 8:1
        </ArticleHeader>

        <Scripture
          text="There is therefore now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus."
          cite="Romans 8:1"
        />

        <p>
          This is really good news! If you are “in Christ,” that means you've
          put your faith in Him, believing that He died for you and rose again
          from the dead on the third day (1 Corinthians 15:4). Anyone in Christ
          is not going to be condemned for their sin and will not go to hell. If
          that's you, then you don't need to walk around feeling guilty or
          shameful over your sin once you've believed in Christ because your sin
          is washed away (1 John 1:7).
        </p>

        <ArticleHeader as="h2" id={Header.SalvationStop5}>
          Stop #5 | Romans 10:9-10
        </ArticleHeader>

        <Scripture
          text='That if you confess with your mouth, "Jesus is Lord," and believe in your heart that God raised Him from the dead, you will be saved.'
          cite="Romans 10:9-10"
        />

        <p>
          The final stop is where the rubber meets the road. Do you believe that
          Jesus is Lord? Do you believe He was the Son of God who died for your
          sin and rose from the dead? Are you willing to confess your sin,
          accepting the bad news that you are spiritually bankrupt without God's
          help? Are you willing to accept the good news that God has made a way
          for you to have a relationship with Him and be saved from the penalty
          of sin, which is His wrath?
        </p>

        <p>
          Through faith in Jesus Christ, God's power can change you. You don't
          have to live a life of brokenness and bondage, you don't have to be
          hopeless. Jesus can set you free. Jesus can give you hope.
        </p>

        <p>
          The question is often asked, how do I know if I'm saved? The simple
          answer is that if you have truly believed in Jesus Christ and put your
          faith in Him, God will transform you. The old ways of sin that you
          used to relish are going to fade, and the new life you live in Christ
          will dominate your passions (2 Corinthians 5:17).
        </p>

        <p>
          In a world looking for solutions to the brokenness of human sin, the
          gospel declares that Jesus is the answer.
