        The following section contains a series of end-times Bible studies that
        I've put together over the years. I've done my best to make them short
        and sweet, but I will typically include references for further study if
        you're interested.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you have any questions or confusion, please consult the Bible, pray
        to God, talk to someone you trust, and/or ask EschatoloGPT.

            The Jews worshiping at the temple mount in the land of Israel is a
            prerequisite to the sacrifices and offerings being taken away.
            Therefore, the Jewish nation of Israel, recently formed in 1948, is
            a sign and precursor to this event which takes place 3.5 years
            before Jesus returns.

                Whereas you saw the feet and toes, partly of potter's clay and
                partly of iron, the kingdom shall be divided; yet the strength
                of the iron shall be in it, just as you saw the iron mixed with
                ceramic clay. And as the toes of the feet were partly of iron
                and partly of clay, so the kingdom shall be partly strong and
                partly fragile. As you saw iron mixed with ceramic clay, they
                will mingle with the seed of men; but they will not adhere to
                one another, just as iron does not mix with clay. And in the
                days of these kings the God of heaven will set up a kingdom
                which shall never be destroyed; and the kingdom shall not be
                left to other people; it shall break in pieces and consume all
                these kingdoms, and it shall stand forever.

            Like the days of Noah, demonic forces (fallen angels) in the last
            days will again try to corrupt humanity's seed. But instead of
            having children with women, will they corrupt us by attempting to
            implant technology (iron) into humans (clay)?

            is a brain implant that allows the human brain to directly interface
            with a computer. When this (or a more advanced version) is implanted
            into a human, does God consider him or her be made in His image
            anymore? If not, can Jesus' sacrifice on the cross atone for that
            person's sins?

                And I stood upon the sand of the sea, and saw a beast rise up
                out of the sea, having seven heads and ten horns, and upon his
                horns ten crowns, and upon his heads the name of blasphemy. And
                the beast which I saw was like unto a leopard, and his feet were
                as the feet of a bear, and his mouth as the mouth of a lion: and
                the dragon gave him his power, and his seat, and great
                authority. And I saw one of his heads as it were wounded to
                death; and his deadly wound was healed: and all the world
                wondered after the beast. And they worshipped the dragon which
                gave power unto the beast: and they worshipped the beast,
                saying, Who is like unto the beast? who is able to make war with
                him? And there was given unto him a mouth speaking great things
                and blasphemies; and power was given unto him to continue forty
                and two months. And he opened his mouth in blasphemy against
                God, to blaspheme his name, and his tabernacle, and them that
                dwell in heaven. And it was given unto him to make war with the
                saints, and to overcome them: and power was given him over all
                kindreds, over all kindreds, and tongues, and nations. And all
                that dwell upon the earth shall worship him, whose names are not
                written in the book of life of the Lamb slain from the
                foundation of the world.

            Today, as we witness the world advancing towards globalism,

            3.5 years before Jesus returns.

            As global powers and shifting alliances catch our attention, the
            Bible reminds us that a future leader will unite the world
            politically, spiritually, and economically. While the phrase "New
            World Order" captures our modern imagination, the core message
            remains that every worldly kingdom, however powerful, stands under
            God's sovereignty. Ultimately, the true and everlasting kingdom is
            the one Jesus will establish at His return.
